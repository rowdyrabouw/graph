# NativeScript drag-n-drop experiment

### Horizontal scrolling the background with pan event
### Horizontal scrolling the left line with pan event
### Vertical scrolling the top line with pan event



<strike>Works fine in iOS, but not in Android</strike>
<strike>- sometimes the lines do scroll</strike>
<strike>- the background doesn't scroll</strike>

Works fine in iOS and Android now
Thanks Eddie and Josh!
